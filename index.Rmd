### Introduction
The purpose of this analysis is to use data from a weight lifting study (Vellosa & al.) and create a prediction tool to predict which type of lift was performed using accelerometer measurements from the belt, forearm, arm and dumbell sensors. There are five classes of lift to be predicted: Class A: exactly according to the specification 
Class B: throwing the elbows to the front 
Class C: lifting the dumbbell only halfway
Class D: lowering the dumbbell only halfway 
Class E: throwing the hips to the front


### Loading libraries and importing data
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr:: opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE, message=FALSE)
```

Load libraries and import training and testing data.
```{r load}

# Library
library(caret)
library(ggplot2)
library(parallel)
library(doParallel)

# Import data
trial <- read.csv("pml-training.csv")
finaltest <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv")
```


### Explore data and remove unnecessary variables
First, we explore the training data, and remove variables that have little relevance to predicting the `classe` variable, or have near zero variance.
```{r explore, results="hide"}
# Explore data
names(trial)
str(trial[,c(1:7)])
table(trial$new_window)
table(trial$num_window)


# Remove variables not useful for prediction
  # first seven variables unlikely to relate to class
  trial <- trial[,-c(1:7)]    

  #Near zero variance variables
  nsv <- nearZeroVar(trial, saveMetrics=TRUE)
  table(nsv$nzv)
  nsv <- subset(nsv, nsv$nzv=="TRUE")
  remove <- rownames(nsv)
  trial <- trial[,!names(trial) %in% remove]
```


There are several variables with large numbers of NA values. 

```{r}

# Explore missing values
trial$na <- apply(is.na(trial), 1, sum)
table(trial$na)   #the majority of rows (19216 out of 19622 have 41 missing values)
```

On exploration, it is found that of the variables remaining, 41 have missing values in 98% of the data. These variables are dropped.
```{r results="hide"}
  # Assess which variables have NA
  temp <- data.frame(colSums(is.na(trial)))
  names(temp) <- c("na")
  subset(temp, na>0)  # NA are all in the same variables for all 19216 rows.

  # Omit these variables that are NA for 19216 rows from the dataset
  omit <- rownames(subset(temp,na>0))
  trial <- trial[,!(names(trial) %in% omit)]
  trial <- subset(trial,select=-c(na))
```


### Create a model and validate it using training data
We will now partition the training dataset to create a `train` and `test` dataset to create our models and test for accuracy

```{r parition}
# Create training and test sets from trial data
set.seed(1234)
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=trial$classe, p=0.7, list=FALSE)
train <- trial[inTrain,]
test <- trial[-inTrain,]
```

We will now turn on parallel processing, and create a random forest model, with 10-fold cross validation.

```{r}

# Parallel processing
cluster <- makeCluster(detectCores() - 1) # convention to leave 1 core for OS
registerDoParallel(cluster)

fitControl <- trainControl(method = "cv",
                           number = 10,
                           allowParallel = TRUE)

# RF model
mrf <- train(classe ~ ., method="rf", data=train, trControl = fitControl)
mrf
```

To test the accuracy of this model, we predict the values in our test partition, then produce a confusion matrix.
```{r}
# Predict values on test set for each model
rf <- predict(mrf, test)

# Confusion matrix for each model
accuracy <- confusionMatrix(rf, test$classe)$overall[1]
confusionMatrix(rf, test$classe)
```

The confusion matrix demonstrates good accuracy of `r round(accuracy*100, 1)`%. 

### Use model to predict values in the test set
Finally, let us move onto predicting classe in the final test set.
We process the final test set to remove variables that were dropped in our training data, then run the prediction using the random forest model from above.

```{r process final test, results="hide"}
# Process the final test set
names(finaltest)
finaltest <- finaltest[,-c(1:7)]
finaltest <- finaltest[,!names(finaltest) %in% remove]  # variables identified in training with near 0 variance
finaltest <- finaltest[,!(names(finaltest) %in% omit)] # variables identified in training with many NA values
```


The final prediction is shown.
```{r}
# Run the prediction
predfinal <- data.frame(predict(mrf, finaltest))
predfinal$num <- c(1:20)
predfinal <- predfinal[,c(2,1)]
names(predfinal) <- c("Item", "Predicted")
predfinal
```

The **expected out of sample error is `r round((1-accuracy)*100, 1)`% (95 confidence interval 0.4-0.8%)**, as determined by the confusion matrix in the previous section.
